# CourseWise - AI-Powered Learning Platform

CourseWise is a modern educational platform built with **Next.js** and **Firebase**, designed to revolutionize the student learning experience through AI-driven personalization.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated **Student Profile Manager** that goes beyond simple grade tracking. It leverages Generative AI (Google Gemini via Genkit) to create a dynamic learning loop:
1.  **Assess**: AI generates custom quizzes based on specific Learning Objectives (LOs).
2.  **Evaluate**: AI grades student answers, providing natural language feedback.
3.  **Adapt**: The system automatically updates the student's mastery of specific skills based on quiz performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## ✨ Feature Deep Dive: Student Profile & AI Assessments

The core of this update is the **Student Profile Manager**, a centralized hub for tracking academic growth.

### 1. 🧠 AI-Powered Adaptive Quizzes
*   **Dynamic Generation**: Unlike static quizzes, our system uses AI to generate unique multiple-choice questions on the fly based on the course's Learning Objectives.
*   **Context-Aware**: Questions are tailored to the specific "Course Title" and target skills (e.g., "Recursion", "Data Structures").
*   **Custom Practice**: Students can click **"+ Create New Quiz"** to generate a fresh practice assessment for *any* course they are enrolled in.

### 2. 🤖 Intelligent Grading & Feedback
*   **Instant Feedback**: The AI evaluates answers immediately, providing a supportive explanation for the overall performance.
*   **Skill Impact Analysis**: The system calculates exactly how a quiz result affects specific skills.
    *   *Example*: Getting a recursion question right might increase your "Understand Recursion" mastery by +10%.
    *   *Visuals*: Green/Red indicators show positive or negative impact on your profile.

### 3. 📊 Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard
*   **Visual Mastery Tracking**: Learning Objectives (LOs) are tracked individually with progress bars.
    *   🟢 **Mastered (>90%)**: Skill acquired.
    *   🟡 **In Progress**: Active learning.
    *   ⚪ **Not Started**: Future topics.
*   **Persistence**: Quiz results and mastery updates are persisted locally, ensuring the student's profile evolves as they take more assessments.

### 4. 🎨 Modern, High-Tech UI
*   **Centered Focus Mode**: Quiz interface designed to minimize distractions.
*   **Interactive Elements**: Smooth animations, hover effects, and clear typography.
*   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and tablet learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS
*   **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI (Radix Primitives)
*   **AI Engine**: Google Genkit + Gemini 2.5 Flash
*   **State Management**: React Hooks + LocalStorage Persistence
*   **Language**: TypeScript
